# 🎯 GuessTheNum - Java Mini Project

This is a simple **number guessing game** written in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is too low or too high. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 0 and 99.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- The program provides feedback:
  - `"Your number is too large"` if the guess is too high.
  - `"Your number is too small"` if the guess is too low.
- When the correct number is guessed, it prints:
  - `"WOOHOO .. CORRECT NUMBER!!!"`
- At the end, it reveals the correct number.
